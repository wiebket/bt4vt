bt4vt - Bias Tests for Voice Tech
=================================

About this Package
==================

``bt4vt`` is a python library to diagnose performance discrepancies (i.e. bias) in speaker verification models. The library provides evaluation measures and visualisations to interrogate model performance and can be integrated into development pipelines to test for bias. We plan to extend the library to other speech processing tasks in future. Speak to us if you're interested to help.

The development of this framework is part of the `Fair EVA open source project <https://www.faireva.org/>`_
